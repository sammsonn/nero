![Nero](./nero.png)

## About
NeroðŸ”¥ is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation Chatbot developed during the HackItAll hackathon organized by Liga StudenÈ›ilor din Facultatea de AutomaticÄƒ È™i Calculatoare BucureÈ™ti (LSAC BucureÈ™ti). The chatbot is designed to provide responses to questions from documents, overcoming the limitations of traditional chatbots with static datasets. It allows for dynamic interaction and can work with private data, making it potentially scalable to enterprise applications in the future.

## Features
- Retrieves relevant information from documents to generate responses to user queries.
- Provides dynamic and contextually relevant answers, enhancing user experience.
- Addresses the static dataset nature of classical chatbots, offering more versatile interactions.
- Can potentially scale to enterprise applications by handling private data securely.
